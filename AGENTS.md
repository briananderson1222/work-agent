# Agent Notes

## Stallion CLI

Always use `./stallion` to manage the app — never raw npm scripts.

```bash
./stallion --help              # Discover all commands and flags
./stallion start               # Start (auto-builds if needed)
./stallion start --clean --force  # Wipe and rebuild from scratch
./stallion stop                # Stop running processes
```

### Port rules

Default ports (3141 server, 3000 UI) are **reserved for user testing**. Agents must always use unique ports:

```bash
./stallion start --clean --force --port=3242 --ui-port=5274
```

Pick ports that won't collide with other agents running concurrently.

### Playwright tests

The `playwright.config.ts` reads `PW_BASE_URL` from the environment. Run tests against your unique UI port:

```bash
PW_BASE_URL=http://localhost:<ui-port> npx playwright test tests/<feature>.spec.ts
```

Tests live in `tests/` and follow these conventions:
- `import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test'`
- Role-based selectors (`getByRole`, `getByText`, `getByPlaceholder`) over CSS
- Seed state via `page.addInitScript` or `page.evaluate`
- Route API calls with `page.route` to isolate from backend state

### Code style

- Prefer CSS classes over inline styles. The project uses `.css` files alongside components.
- **Use `useQuery` / `useMutation` from `@tanstack/react-query` for all data fetching.** Never use raw `useState` + `useCallback(fetch)` + `useEffect` patterns. The SDK (`@stallion-ai/sdk`) exports domain-specific hooks (`useAgentsQuery`, `useProjectsQuery`, `useLayoutsQuery`, etc.) — prefer those over raw `useQuery` when available. For views, destructure `isLoading` and pass it to `SplitPaneLayout`'s `loading` prop. After mutations, call `queryClient.invalidateQueries()` instead of manual refetch functions.

### Navigation

Project layout navigation MUST go through `setLayout(projectSlug, layoutSlug)` from `useNavigation()` — never raw `navigate(`/projects/...`)`. `setLayout` persists `lastProject`/`lastProjectLayout` to localStorage so `/` can restore the user's last-viewed project on reload. Raw `navigate()` only pushes the URL without persisting, which breaks restore-on-reload.

- `setLayout(projectSlug, layoutSlug)` — project layout navigation (persists + navigates)
- `setStandaloneLayout(slug)` — standalone layout navigation
- `navigate(path)` — everything else (settings, agents, plugins, etc.)

The root route (`/`) auto-selects in this priority: (1) last-viewed project+layout from localStorage, (2) first project's first layout, (3) standalone layout fallback.

### Known issues

- The ChatDock overlay intercepts pointer events on sidebar buttons near the bottom of the viewport. Use `element.dispatchEvent('click')` in Playwright tests to bypass.

### Notification system

The notification system follows the provider pattern. Core is abstract — it knows about "notifications" but not what generates them (calendar events, build results, etc.).

**Architecture:**
- `INotificationProvider` (additive) — plugins register providers that contribute notifications via `poll()`
- `NotificationService` — aggregates providers, manages lifecycle (schedule/deliver/dismiss/snooze), persists to `~/.stallion-ai/notifications.json`
- REST API at `/notifications` — CRUD + action + snooze + filter by status/category
- SSE bridge — `notification:delivered` events push into the ToastStore for immediate UI display
- Web Push — generalized `usePushNotifications` hook + `sw.js` handles both tool-approval and generic payloads

**Shared primitives** (extracted from BuiltinScheduler for DRY):
- `src-server/services/cron.ts` — pure cron matching functions
- `src-server/services/json-store.ts` — `JsonFileStore<T>` typed JSON persistence
- `src-server/services/sse-broadcaster.ts` — `SSEBroadcaster` SSE fan-out (used by BuiltinScheduler + SchedulerService)

**SDK hooks for plugins:**
- `useNotifications()` — `notify()` (immediate toast), `schedule()` (server-side), `dismiss()`
- `NotificationsAPI` class — full REST client for programmatic access

**Key design decisions:**
- `category` is free-form string — plugins define their own (e.g. `'meeting-reminder'`, `'build-complete'`)
- `metadata` is opaque to core — plugins store domain-specific data, core just persists and delivers
- `dedupeTag` prevents duplicate notifications without core knowing the domain
- Tool-approval was NOT migrated — it's streaming-event-driven (ephemeral), not a scheduled notification

# Stallion Architecture

## System Overview

Stallion is a local-first AI agent system built on Amazon Bedrock. It runs as a self-hosted server that users deploy alongside their own plugins — the core is a generic foundation, and plugins are the product.

**Core/plugin boundary:**
- The core server (`src-server/`) provides the runtime, HTTP API, streaming pipeline, MCP lifecycle, and provider registry. It has no domain-specific logic.
- Plugins are installed into `.stallion-ai/plugins/` and register providers (auth, branding, agent registry, tool registry, settings, onboarding) that the core discovers at startup. Plugins can also ship agents, tools, and UI components.
- The SDK (`packages/sdk/`) is the contract between the core and plugin UIs — plugins import from `@stallion-ai/sdk` and never call the server directly.

This means the core can be upgraded independently of plugins, and plugins can be swapped without touching the runtime.

## Data Flow: Chat Request

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant UI
    participant Server as POST /api/agents/:slug/chat
    participant ACP as ACPManager
    participant Agent
    participant Pipeline as StreamPipeline
    participant MCP as MCP Server
    participant Bedrock

    UI->>Server: {input, conversationId, userId}
    Server->>Server: resolve agent (or ACP route)
    alt ACP agent
        Server->>ACP: handleChat()
        ACP-->>UI: SSE stream (translated from ACP protocol)
    else local agent
        Server->>Agent: streamText(input, options)
        Agent->>Bedrock: invoke model (streaming)
        Bedrock-->>Agent: token stream
        Agent-->>Pipeline: fullStream (AsyncIterable)
        loop each chunk
            Pipeline->>Pipeline: TextDeltaHandler → ReasoningHandler → ToolCallHandler → CompletionHandler → MetadataHandler
            Pipeline-->>UI: SSE data: {type, ...}
        end
        alt tool call required
            Agent->>MCP: execute tool
            MCP-->>Agent: tool result
            Note over Agent,Pipeline: if not auto-approved, InjectableStream injects<br/>tool-approval-request event; UI responds to<br/>/tool-approval/:id before execution continues
        end
        Server-->>UI: data: [DONE]
    end
```

Key SSE event types emitted during a chat:
- `conversation-started` — new conversation ID (first message only)
- `text-delta` — incremental text token
- `reasoning` — model reasoning/thinking content
- `tool-call` — tool invocation with args
- `tool-result` — tool execution result
- `tool-approval-request` — pauses stream, waits for user approval
- `completion` — final usage stats and finish reason
- `error` — stream-level error

## Plugin Lifecycle

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Installed: POST /api/plugins/install
    Installed --> Built: build.mjs / build.sh runs
    Built --> Loaded: server restart or reload
    Loaded --> Active: providers registered in registry
    Active --> Uninstalled: DELETE /api/plugins/:name
    Uninstalled --> [*]: files removed, registry cleared
```

**Install** — The plugin directory is copied into `.stallion-ai/plugins/<name>/`. If a `build.mjs` or `build.sh` exists, it runs to produce `dist/`.

**Load** — On startup (or after a reload), `loadPluginProviders()` scans `plugins/`, reads each `plugin.json` manifest, and dynamically imports provider modules. Each provider is registered in the appropriate singleton slot (auth, branding, agentRegistry, etc.).

**Render** — Plugin UI bundles are served from `/api/plugins/:name/dist/:file`. The web UI loads them as ES module chunks. Plugins use `@stallion-ai/sdk` hooks and components — they never call the server directly.

**Uninstall** — The plugin directory is deleted. On next reload, the registry is cleared and rebuilt without the removed plugin. Agents and tools installed by the plugin are also removed.

---

## Agent Lifecycle

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Defined: agent YAML written to .stallion-ai/agents/
    Defined --> Loading: createAgentInstance()
    Loading --> MCPConnect: MCPManager.loadTools()
    MCPConnect --> Ready: agent registered in activeAgents
    Ready --> Running: POST /api/agents/:slug/chat
    Running --> Ready: stream complete
    Ready --> Reloaded: config file change detected
    Reloaded --> Loading
    Ready --> Removed: agent YAML deleted
    Removed --> [*]
```

**Define** — An agent is a YAML file in `.stallion-ai/agents/<slug>/agent.yaml` (schema: `schemas/agent.schema.json`). It specifies model, prompt, tools, guardrails, and MCP server references.

**Load** — `createAgentInstance()` reads the spec, resolves the Bedrock model, creates a `FileMemoryAdapter`, and delegates to the active framework adapter.

**MCP Connect** — For each `tools.mcpServers` entry, `MCPManager` creates an `MCPConfiguration` (stdio, HTTP, or WebSocket transport), connects, and loads the tool list. Tool names are normalized to avoid collisions.

**Chat** — `agent.streamText()` is called with the user input and conversation context. The result's `fullStream` is piped through the `StreamPipeline` and written as SSE.

**Monitor** — `agent-start` and `agent-complete` events are emitted to `monitoringEvents` and persisted to `.stallion-ai/monitoring/events-<date>.ndjson`. OTel spans and metrics are recorded for each request.

---

## ACP (Agent Communication Protocol)

ACP connects Stallion to external CLI runtimes (e.g. kiro-cli). The `ACPManager` spawns the CLI as a subprocess and communicates over stdio using the `@agentclientprotocol/sdk`.

Each ACP connection exposes:
- **Virtual agents** — the CLI's available modes appear as agents in the Stallion agent list
- **Slash commands** — mode-specific commands surfaced in the chat UI
- **Chat delegation** — `POST /api/agents/:slug/chat` routes to `acpBridge.handleChat()` when the slug belongs to an ACP agent; the response is translated to the same SSE format the UI expects

ACP connections are configured in `.stallion-ai/config/acp.json` and managed via `/acp/connections` CRUD endpoints.

> For full protocol details, see `guides/acp.md` (forthcoming).

---

## Streaming Pipeline

The `StreamPipeline` is a chain of `StreamHandler` instances, each implemented as an async generator. Handlers process the output of the previous handler — zero or more output chunks per input chunk.

```mermaid
graph LR
    FS[fullStream] --> IS[InjectableStream.wrap]
    IS --> RH[ReasoningHandler]
    RH --> TDH[TextDeltaHandler]
    TDH --> TCH[ToolCallHandler]
    TCH --> CH[CompletionHandler]
    CH --> MH[MetadataHandler]
    MH --> SSE[SSE writer]
```

| Handler | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `ReasoningHandler` | Buffers `<thinking>` blocks; emits `reasoning` events; holds all chunks during thinking so injected approval events appear at the right boundary |
| `TextDeltaHandler` | Pass-through for text events (reasoning handler already formats them correctly) |
| `ToolCallHandler` | Augments `tool-call` events with parsed `server` and `tool` fields for UI display |
| `CompletionHandler` | Tracks accumulated text, finish reason, and whether any output was produced |
| `MetadataHandler` | Emits usage stats and monitoring events on stream completion |

The `InjectableStream` wrapper allows the elicitation callback to inject `tool-approval-request` events into the stream at chunk boundaries without modifying the underlying `fullStream`.

Abort is handled via `AbortController` — the pipeline checks the signal before each yielded chunk, and the client disconnect listener calls `abort()`.

## Extension Points

| Extension Point | How to Hook In |
|---|---|
| **Auth provider** | Plugin registers `AuthProvider` — controls login, session validation, and user identity |
| **Agent registry** | Plugin registers `AgentRegistryProvider` — supplies the browsable agent catalog |
| **Tool registry** | Plugin registers `ToolRegistryProvider` — supplies the browsable tool/MCP catalog |
| **Branding** | Plugin registers `BrandingProvider` — overrides logo, colors, app name |
| **Settings** | Plugin registers `SettingsProvider` — adds plugin-specific settings UI |
| **Onboarding** | Plugin registers `OnboardingProvider` — controls the first-run flow |
| **MCP tools** | Any stdio/HTTP/WebSocket MCP server can be referenced in an agent's `tools.mcpServers` |
| **ACP connections** | Any CLI that implements the Agent Client Protocol can be connected via `/acp/connections` |
| **Voice providers** | Plugins register `STTProvider`, `TTSProvider`, or `ConversationalVoiceProvider` via `voiceRegistry` (SDK) |
| **Context providers** | Plugins register `MessageContextProvider` via `contextRegistry` (SDK) to inject context into chat messages |
| **Workspace providers** | Plugins register workspace-level data providers via `registerProvider` (SDK) |
| **Scheduler** | Agents can be invoked on a cron schedule via `POST /scheduler/jobs` |
